            <p>
                A separate prize called "Super Golden Ball" was awarded to Alfredo Di Stefano in 1989 after he surpassed Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini in voting for France Football [7]. After 10 years the magazine named Pele "Player of the Century" after consulting with the owners of "Golden Balls". Of the 34 awardees, 30 agreed with the recognition of Pele; Stanley Matthews, George Best and Omar Sivori abstained, and Lev Yashin was already dead. Each of the voters was allocated 5 seats, the first received 5 points, the second - 4, the third - three, the fourth - 2, and the fifth - one point. However, Di Stefano chose only the first place, Platini - the first and second place, and George Wea in the fifth place was two players. Pele was named the best 17 votes, while the second place was taken by Diego Maradona, who collected almost half the votes
